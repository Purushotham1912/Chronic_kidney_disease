## Preprocessing Steps

1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   Identify and either remove or impute any missing values in the dataset using appropriate strategies.

2. **Handling Duplicate Values**:
   Identify and remove duplicate rows from the dataset.

3. **Feature Scaling**:
   Scale or standardize features depending on the nature of the analysis to ensure uniformity.

4. **Encoding Categorical Variables**:
   Apply appropriate encoding techniques to categorical variables if present in the dataset.

5. **Feature Engineering**:
   Create new features from existing ones to capture meaningful information.

6. **Data Exploration**:
   Perform exploratory data analysis to understand data distributions, relationships, and anomalies.

**file3-> Exploratory Data Analysis[EDA]** :
   In the realm of exploratory data analysis, the chronic kidney disease dataset pulsates with latent insights. Through rigorous analysis and dynamic visualization, we unravel hidden patterns, correlations, and 
   potential disease connections, ultimately shaping predictive models that distill its essence.

## Machine Learning Extension

After preprocessing, the project is further extended to include machine learning analysis. The following steps are undertaken:

1. **Algorithm Selection**:
   Implement a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and more.

2. **Model Evaluation**:
   Train each algorithm on the preprocessed dataset and evaluate their accuracy using appropriate metrics.

3. **Optimal Algorithm Selection**:
   Identify the algorithm with the highest accuracy and select it as the optimal choice.

4. **Model Deployment**:
   Deploy the chosen algorithm to make accurate predictions on new data.

## Web Application Development

A web application is currently in development to provide an interactive interface for users. This application will allow users to input relevant data and receive predictions based on the chosen machine learning model.
